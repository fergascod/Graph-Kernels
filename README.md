# Graph-Kernels
The main goal of this project was to design a Machine Learning model that would predict the chromatic number of a graph. We generated a dataset of graphs using several methods: Erdös-Rényi, Watts-Strogatz and Barabási-Albert. We used the igraph Python library to generate the graphs and the grinpy library to get the exact calculation of the chromatic number. File `data_gen.py` contains the full generation of the dataset and the final dataset used can be found in directory `data`. The ML methods we implemented can be found in file `colors.Rmd`. 

The full results of the project and the methods used can be found in the file `Report.pdf`.
